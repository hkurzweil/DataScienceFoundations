  "title": "What is Data Science?",
  "body": " What is Data Science?   Defining Data Science  Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines domain knowledge, programming skills, and statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights from data. At its core, data science is about using data to answer questions, solve problems, and make decisions.   The Data Science Venn Diagram   A Venn diagram showing data science as the intersection of domain expertise, mathematics\/statistics, and computer science.    Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach    The field of data science has evolved from statistics, computer science, and specific domain applications. While statisticians have been analyzing data for centuries, modern data science incorporates newer tools and techniques to handle larger, more complex datasets and to gain deeper insights into the data to solve real world problems.   Data Science Concepts   Which of the following best describes data science?      An interdisciplinary field that combines domain knowledge, programming skills, and statistical techniques to extract insights from data    Correct! Data science combines multiple disciplines to analyze and interpret data.      A branch of computer science focused exclusively on machine learning algorithms    While machine learning is part of data science, data science is broader and includes other disciplines.      A synonym for statistics that uses modern technology    Statistics is a component of data science, but data science also incorporates programming, domain expertise, and other skills.      The process of creating visual representations of large datasets    Data visualization is an important part of data science, but data science encompasses much more.       Exploring Data Science History: Snow's Cholera Map   Long before the term \"data science\" existed, people were using data to solve important problems. One of the most famous historical examples is Dr. John Snow's investigation of a cholera outbreak in London in 1854.  During a severe cholera outbreak in the Soho district of London, Dr. Snow collected data on the locations of cholera deaths and plotted them on a map. By carefully mapping each case, he noticed a pattern: the deaths clustered around a specific water pump on Broad Street. This spatial analysis led him to hypothesize that contaminated water, not \"bad air\" (the prevailing theory at the time), was responsible for spreading the disease.   John Snow's Original Cholera Map (1854)   John Snow's map showing cholera cases clustered around the Broad Street pump in London.    National Geographic    Snow's methods included:    Data collection: Recording the locations of cholera deaths    Spatial analysis: Plotting cases on a map to identify patterns    Hypothesis testing: Testing his theory by investigating the water source    Intervention: Recommending the removal of the pump handle, which helped end the outbreak    This early example of data-driven decision making saved lives and helped establish the field of epidemiology.     How is Snow's approach similar to modern data science methods? Identify at least two similarities.      What limitations did Snow face in his data collection and analysis? How might these have affected his conclusions?      If Snow had access to modern data science tools (like CODAP, GIS systems, or statistical software), how might his analysis have been enhanced or expanded?       Why Data Literacy Matters  Data literacy—the ability to read, work with, analyze, and communicate with data—has become an essential skill in the 21st century. Whether you're making personal decisions, participating in civic discussions, or pursuing a career, understanding data helps you:    Make informed decisions based on evidence rather than intuition alone    Critically evaluate claims that others make using data    Communicate your own findings effectively    Identify misleading presentations of data    Understand complex systems and patterns in the world      Consider a news article that claims \"Violent crime has surged by 30% this year.\" A data-literate person would ask:    Compared to what baseline? (Last year? Five years ago? The lowest point ever recorded?)    What specific crimes are included in \"violent crime\"?    What geographic area does this apply to?    Has the way crimes are reported or recorded changed?    Is a percentage the most appropriate measure, or would raw numbers provide important context?       Data Literacy in the News   In this activity, we'll practice data literacy by examining news articles.     Go to Google and navigate to the News tab. Type in Data about and enter in a topic you're interested in. Choose an article that looks interesting to you.      Identify at least three questions you would ask to better understand the data behind the claim.      If possible, find the original data source and determine if the article's interpretation seems accurate.       Data Literacy Skills   Match each data literacy skill with its appropriate example.     Critical evaluation of claims  Questioning a news headline about crime statistics by examining the source data    Making informed decisions  Choosing between job offers by comparing salary and benefits data    Identifying misleading presentations  Noticing that a graph's y-axis doesn't start at zero, exaggerating differences    Effective communication of findings  Creating a clear visualization that shows the key trends in your research    Understanding complex patterns  Recognizing seasonal variations in multiple years of sales data      Applications of Data Science  Data science methods are transforming virtually every field:    Healthcare   Predicting disease outbreaks  Personalizing treatment plans  Improving diagnostic accuracy  Optimizing hospital operations     Business   Customer segmentation  Demand forecasting  Process optimization  Fraud detection       Environmental Science   Climate modeling  Ecosystem monitoring  Pollution tracking  Resource management     Social Sciences   Analyzing social networks  Studying behavioral patterns  Evaluating program effectiveness  Understanding demographic trends      Data Science in Your Field of Interest   In this activity, you'll explore how data science is used in a field that interests you.     Select a field or industry that interests you.      Research and identify at least three specific ways data science is being applied in this field.      For one application, describe the data that might be collected, how it might be analyzed, and what insights it provides.      "

  "title": "Understanding Data Types",
  "body": " Understanding Data Types   Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data  One of the most fundamental distinctions in data is between qualitative and quantitative data:     Qualitative data (also called categorical data) represents characteristics that can be observed but not measured numerically. Qualitative data can be classified into categories.       Quantitative data represents information that can be measured numerically and can be used in calculations.      Consider the following variables from our Community Health dataset:    Qualitative : Neighborhood name, zip code, predominant housing type    Quantitative : Asthma rate (%), air quality index, median household income ($), number of parks       Identifying Data Types   In this activity, you'll practice identifying qualitative and quantitative data.     For the sample Community Health dataset, identify whether each variable is qualitative or quantitative:   Neighborhood  Population density  Predominant land use  Percent green space  Average temperature (°F)  Healthcare access rating       Now examine your chosen dataset and classify each variable as qualitative or quantitative.       Identifying Data Types   Which of the following is an example of quantitative data?      Hair color    Hair color is qualitative (categorical) data as it represents a characteristic that can be categorized but not measured numerically.      Zip code    Although zip codes contain numbers, they are actually qualitative data because they represent categories (geographic regions) rather than measurements.      Height in centimeters    Correct! Height in centimeters is quantitative data because it represents a numerical measurement that can be used in calculations.      Blood type    Blood type (A, B, AB, O) is qualitative data as it represents categories rather than numerical measurements.       Measurement Scales  Data can be further classified by measurement scale, which affects what operations and analyses make sense for that data.     Nominal data represents categories with no inherent order. The only valid operation is determining equality (same or different).       Ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the differences between values may not be consistent or meaningful.       Interval data has consistent differences between values, but lacks a meaningful zero point.       Ratio data has consistent differences between values and a meaningful zero point (zero represents the absence of the quantity).      Examples from our Community Health dataset:    Nominal : Neighborhood name, predominant land use (residential, commercial, industrial, mixed)    Ordinal : Healthcare access rating (poor, fair, good, excellent), air quality category (unhealthy, moderate, good)    Interval : Temperature (°F or °C) - the difference between 70°F and 80°F is the same as between 80°F and 90°F, but 0°F doesn't represent the absence of temperature    Ratio : Asthma rate (%), income ($), number of parks, population - zero means none, and the difference between values is consistent       Understanding measurement scales helps you determine appropriate:   Summary statistics (mean, median, mode)  Visualization methods (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots)  Analysis techniques (correlation, regression, categorical tests)     Classifying by Measurement Scale   In this activity, you'll practice identifying measurement scales.     For each variable below, identify its measurement scale (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio):   ZIP code  Education level (no high school, high school, bachelor's, graduate)  Annual rainfall (inches)  Birth month  Satisfaction rating (1-5 scale)  Distance from city center (miles)       Now examine your chosen dataset and classify each variable by measurement scale.       Measurement Scales   Match each variable with its appropriate measurement scale.     Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit  Interval    Brand preference (Favorite soda brand)  Nominal    Customer satisfaction rating (1-5 stars)  Ordinal    Height in centimeters  Ratio    Academic letter grades (A, B, C, D, F)  Ordinal    Weight in kilograms  Ratio      Other Data Classifications  Beyond the qualitative\/quantitative and measurement scale distinctions, there are other useful ways to classify data:     Discrete data can only take specific values (usually whole numbers), while continuous data can take any value within a range.      From our Community Health dataset:    Discrete : Number of parks, number of healthcare facilities, population count    Continuous : Air quality index, median income, percent green space, asthma rate         Structured data is organized in a predefined format (like a spreadsheet or database), while unstructured data doesn't conform to a predefined data model (text, images, audio).    In this course, we'll primarily work with structured data, but it's important to know that unstructured data constitutes the majority of data generated today.   Data Type Review   Which of the following statements about data types and classifications is correct?      All numerical data is quantitative and all text data is qualitative.    Not all numerical data is quantitative. For example, zip codes are numerical but are considered qualitative (nominal) data.      Nominal and ordinal scales are types of quantitative data.    Nominal and ordinal scales are actually types of qualitative (categorical) data.      Interval data has a true zero point, while ratio data does not.    This is reversed. Ratio data has a true zero point (representing the absence of the quantity), while interval data does not.      Discrete data can only take specific values, while continuous data can take any value within a range.    Correct! Discrete data is limited to specific values (usually whole numbers), while continuous data can take any value within a range, including fractional values.         Tidy data is a specific way of organizing data where:   Each variable forms a column  Each observation forms a row  Each type of observational unit forms a table      Untidy Data   The untidy data format has values that are spread across multiple columns.     Tidy Data   The tidy data format has variables as columns and observations as rows.    Tidy data makes analysis and visualization more straightforward, as most analysis tools (including CODAP) are designed to work with data in this format.   Identifying Tidy Data   In this activity, you'll practice identifying tidy and untidy data.     Examine the following datasets in CODAP:    Open a new CODAP document    Click on \"Example Documents\" in the main menu    Open both \"Mammals\" and \"Speed Trap\"        For each dataset, determine if it follows the principles of tidy data. If not, explain what would need to change to make it tidy.      Examine your chosen project dataset. Is it in tidy format? If not, what would need to change?      "

The data we collect and how we collect it has real impacts on people's lives.  Key ethical considerations in data collection include:    Consent : Were people informed about how their data would be used?    Privacy : Is sensitive information protected?    Representativeness : Does the data collection process exclude certain groups?    Transparency : Is the collection process clear and documented?    Minimization : Is only necessary data collected?      In our Community Health dataset, consider these ethical questions:    Are the neighborhoods defined in ways that might reinforce historical segregation?    Does the dataset include communities that are often underrepresented in research?    Is the aggregation level appropriate to protect individual privacy while still being useful?    Were community members involved in deciding what data to collect about their neighborhoods?       Data Ethics Discussion   In this activity, we'll discuss ethical considerations for our datasets.     For the Community Health dataset, identify at least two potential ethical concerns and how you might address them.      For your chosen project dataset, consider:    What was the original purpose of this data collection?    Who collected it and how?    Who might be missing from or underrepresented in this dataset?
