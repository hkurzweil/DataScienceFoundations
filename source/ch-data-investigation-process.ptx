      <title>Unit 2: The Data Investigation Process</title>
      
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Having established a foundation in data science concepts and explored various types of data, we now turn our attention to the process of data investigation. In this unit, we'll learn a structured framework for approaching data problems, practice formulating meaningful statistical questions, and develop plans for investigating those questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this unit, we'll continue working with our Community Health and Environment dataset while you develop investigation plans for your own chosen datasets. By the end of this unit, you'll have a roadmap for the analyses you'll conduct in the coming weeks.

          <title>Overview of the Framework</title>
          
          <p>
            Hollylynne Lee and her colleagues at North Carolina State University have developed a comprehensive framework for data investigations in their paper<url href="https://iase-pub.org/ojs/SERJ/article/view/41/457" visual="https://iase-pub.org/ojs/SERJ/article/view/41/457">Investigating Data Like a Scientist: Key Practices and Processes</url> that helps structure the process of working with data. This framework, seen below, provides a roadmap that can guide us through the complexity of real-world data analysis.

          <p>
            The framework consists of four interconnected phases:
          </p>
          
          <dl>
            <li>
              <title>Ask Questions</title>
              <p>
                Formulate statistical questions that can be answered with data. These questions should anticipate variability and focus on distributions rather than individual cases.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Consider Data</title>
              <p>
                Evaluate available data sources, collection methods, and variables. Consider what additional data might be needed and assess the quality and appropriateness of the data for answering your questions.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Analyze Data</title>
              <p>
                Apply appropriate techniques to organize, summarize, and visualize the data. This includes cleaning the data, creating meaningful representations, and identifying patterns.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Interpret Results</title>
              <p>
                Make claims based on the evidence from your analysis, acknowledge limitations, and consider implications. This often leads to new questions, continuing the cycle.
              </p>
            </li>
          </dl>
          
          <p>
            While the framework is presented as a cycle, real investigations rarely follows that circle perfectly. You might need to revisit earlier phases as you gain insights or encounter challenges. Iteration is essential in data analysis.

          <title>The Framework in Practice</title>
          
          <p>
            Let's see how this framework might apply to our Community Health and Environment project:
          </p>
          
          <example xml:id="example-framework-health">
            <title>Community Health Investigation</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                <term>Ask Questions</term>: How does air quality relate to asthma rates across different neighborhoods? Do these relationships differ based on income levels?
              </p>
              <p>
                <term>Consider Data</term>: Our dataset includes air quality measurements, asthma prevalence rates, and median household income for various neighborhoods. We need to consider how air quality was measured, whether measurements were taken consistently, and if there are confounding variables we should account for.
              </p>
              <p>
                <term>Analyze Data</term>: We might create scatterplots of air quality versus asthma rates, calculate correlation coefficients, and group neighborhoods by income levels to compare patterns. We'd also need to handle any missing values or outliers.
              </p>
              <p>
                <term>Interpret Results</term>: Based on our analysis, we might find that neighborhoods with poorer air quality tend to have higher asthma rates, and this relationship could be stronger in lower-income areas. We'd need to acknowledge limitations (correlation doesn't imply causation) and consider implications for public health policy.
              </p>
            </statement>
          </example>
          
          <p>
            The framework helps ensure that we approach data investigations systematically, considering crucial aspects at each stage. It also highlights the iterative nature of data analysisâ€”insights from later phases often prompt us to refine our questions or seek additional data.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>How has the data investigation framework changed your approach to analyzing data?</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>What was most challenging about formulating effective statistical questions?</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>How does understanding variability influence the way you think about data?</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>What aspects of your investigation plan are you most confident about, and which might need refinement as you proceed?</p>

          <title>Unit 2 Review</title>
          <statement>
            <p>Which of the following BEST describes the main purpose of the data investigation framework?</p>
          </statement>
          <choices>
            <choice>
              <statement>
                <p>To provide a rigid, linear sequence of steps that must be followed in every data analysis</p>
              </statement>
              <feedback>
                <p>The framework is not meant to be rigid or strictly linear. Real investigations often involve cycling back through earlier phases as new insights emerge.</p>
              </feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
              <statement>
                <p>To replace critical thinking with standardized procedures for data analysis</p>
              </statement>
              <feedback>
                <p>The framework is designed to enhance critical thinking, not replace it. It provides a structure while still requiring judgment and creativity.</p>
              </feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice correct="yes">
              <statement>
                <p>To provide a structured approach that ensures all important aspects of data investigation are considered</p>
              </statement>
              <feedback>
                <p>Correct! The framework serves as a guide to help ensure that important elements like question formulation, data quality assessment, appropriate analysis, and careful interpretation are all addressed.</p>
              </feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
              <statement>
                <p>To automate the process of analyzing data so that minimal human intervention is required</p>
              </statement>
              <feedback>
                <p>The framework does not automate analysis; it provides a conceptual structure for human investigators to follow while still requiring substantial judgment and expertise.</p>
